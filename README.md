# Piscine: Python for Data Science

## Day 1: Starting

### Exercise 00

Exploring basic data objects

### Exercise 01

Write a script to print time in a specific format

### Exercise 02

Exploring object types

### Exercise 03

All types of NULL in python

### Exercise 04

The Even and the Odd

### Exercise 05

Program, with a main, which takes
a single string argument and displays the sums of its upper-case characters, lower-case
characters, punctuation characters, digits and spaces

### Exercise 06

Part 1:

Recode your own ft_filter, it should behave like the original built-in function
(it should return the same thing as "print(filter.**doc**)"), you should use list comprehensions to recode your ft_filter.

Part 2:

Create a program that accepts two arguments: a string(S), and an integer(N). The program should output a list of words from S that have a length greater than N.

• Words are separated from each other by space characters.

• Strings do not contain any special characters. (Punctuation or invisible)

• The program must contain at least one list comprehension expression and one
lambda.

• If the number of argument is different from 2, or if the type of any argument is wrong,
the program prints an AssertionError.

### Exercise 07

Make a program that takes a string as an argument and encodes it into Morse Code.

• The program supports space and alphanumeric characters

• An alphanumeric character is represented by dots . and dashes -

• Complete morse characters are separated by a single space

• A space character is represented by a slash /

You must use a dictionary to store your morse code.

### Exercise 08

Create a function called ft_tqdm (a progress bar library).
The function must copy the function `tqdm` (a progress bar library) with the yield operator.

### Exercise 09

Create a package in python the way you want, it will appear in the list of
installed packages when you type the command "pip list" and display its characteristics
when you type "pip show -v ft_package"

## Day 2: Array

### Exercise 00

Your function, give_bmi, take 2 lists of integers or floats in input and returns a list
of BMI values.
Your function, apply_limit, accepts a list of integers or floats and an integer representing
a limit as parameters. It returns a list of booleans (True if above the limit).
You have to handle error cases if the lists are not the same size, are not int or float...

### Exercise 01

Write a function that takes as parameters a 2D array, prints its shape, and returns a
truncated version of the array based on the provided start and end arguments.
You must use the slicing method.
You have to handle error cases if the lists are not the same size, are not a list ...

### Exercise 02

Write a function that loads an image, prints its format, and its pixels
content in RGB format.
You have to handle, at least, JPG and JPEG format.
You need to handle any error with a clear error message

### Exercise 03

Create a program that should load the image "animal.jpeg", print some information
about it and display it after "zooming".

• The size in pixel on both X and Y axis

• The number of channel

• The pixel content of the image.

• Display the scale on the x and y axis on the image

If anything went wrong, the program must not stop abruptly and handle any error
with a clear message.

### Exercise 04

Make a program which must load the image "animal.jpeg", cut a square part from it
and transpose it to produce the image below. It should display it, print the new shape
and the data of the image after the transpose.

### Exercise 05

You need to develop 5 functions capable of applying a variety of color filters to images,
while keeping the image shape the same.

You have some restriction operators for each function: (you can only use those given,
you don’t have to use them all)

• invert: =, +, -, \*

• red: =, \*

• green: =, -

• blue: =

• grey: =, /

## Day 4: OOP

Replayed Game of Thrones in python, genius references where the Lannister class takes everything

## Day 5: Dod

### Exercise 00

Statistics and keyword arguments (kwargs)

### Exercise 01

inner functions, non-local variables

### Exercise 02

Kinda same as 01 with extra functionality

### Exercise 03

Data class and field option
